## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice statistical analysis using the iterative data analysis process with the following dataset.

[Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

**The goal of your analysis is to identify the most important features of houses that affect the sale prices.**

Because the variable is a price variable you need to make a research on the market to construct your hipoteses.

**correlation doenst mean causation**

The price on real estate its very corellated to the square feet, 
because its one KPY (price per sq.feet) that people/consumers use to evaluate and compare prices.
